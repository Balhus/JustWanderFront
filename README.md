# JustWanderFront
This is the front end of JustWander.

There is a lot of shops/commerces that are hidden or not on the usual tourists areas, so not a lot of people know them, but these shops might have some unique products, have some amazing typical dishes of the zone or who knows what. 
JustWander is a web page for people to find shops/commerces/restaurants in cities that are unknown by foreigners and even for people that live in that city. The objective of JustWander is for tourists to discover not only the mainstream places of the cities they visit, but also the hidden places you would only know if you lived there for years, this way you can truly experience the essence of the city.

Right now the web page is being designed in mobile, once that is fully done I'll move to the desktop version.
